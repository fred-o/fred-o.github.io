I'm reading [Java Concurrency In Practice][jcip] right now. It's
something I've been meaning to do for a long time, as it seemed like
somthing that should be required reading for any Java programmer worth
his salt, but somehow I never got around to it until now. I'm glad I
did though, because the book is a realy eye-opener.

Where most programming books nowadays go out of their way to show you
just how fun and easy coding is, JCIP seems to say: "You know, coding
for concurrency is really, really hard and you're doing it wrong. Are
you sure you should be programming at all?". Or something like
that. The tone of the book isn't condecending or arrogant, 

The first chapters are especially depressing, as the authors point out all of the 

Depressing, because most of my programs are wrong

Only hold for single-threaded, but almost no programs are single-threaded 

Java code made for concurrency is ugly

You have to think about it all the time
