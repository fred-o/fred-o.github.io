If you are using emacs for anything more involved than editing config
files every now and then you owe it to yourself try out a productivity
enhancer like [ido-mode][ido]. It lives in the minibuffer and provides
way better completion for file names, emacs commands, buffers, you
name it. Seriously, check it out if you haven't already.

In all fairness, I should probably point out [icicles][ice] as well as
it seems to provide much of the same functionality as
[ido-mode][ido]. But since I've never used it I can't really comment
on it.
