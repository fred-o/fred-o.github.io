So yeah, a year passed by. That happens sometimes.

Not much was achieved blog-wise, but behind the scenes I've been
busy. We had a child, a wonderful boy who will turn two in
September. Six months paternity leave just wooshed by. It was
glorious. I barely touched a computer for half a year. That's an
experience I can heartily recommend.

Also, [this experiment]({% post_url 2011-04-06-going-remote %}) 
is coming to a close. In August we'll be moving back to Uppsala. 
Turns out homesickness is a powerful thing. Good-bye Pite√•, we 
had a good run.
