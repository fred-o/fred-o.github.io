Last year [Jfokus][jf] ran an embedded systems track alongside the
main conference, and this was met with considerable enthusiasm. It was
a friendly refuge from [corporate keynotes][oracle] and enterprise
bloatware seminars, a place where you could escape the buzzwords and
marketing people. I discovered that the [Raspberry Pi][pi] was an
actual thing that existed and could be ordered from the internet, and
within 60 minutes I [had done just that][pi-initial-thoughts].

Apart from putting together the odd PC back in the late 90's, I'm
generally clueless about hardware. I don't know what the state of the
art for RAM or CPUs are nowadays; in fact I don't even know how many
cores the MacBook I'm typing this on is running. Hardware is a
nuisance; the problems that interest me all lie deep into software
country.

However, the Raspberry Pi has awakened my curiosity for circuit
boards, ports and capacitors. I want to learn about microcontrollers,
I want to find out how [GPIO][gpio] works. God help me, *I want to
solder.*

Karin from [r-pi.se][rpi] had a table at the conference, and seemed to
be doing a brisk trade. This photo was taken during a lull in traffic,
but usually it was so crowded you couldn't even see the table.

I couldn't resist getting a [PiFace][piface] board; I've been wanting
to add a display to my pi as I tend to run it headless and it would be
nice to have some way of displaying status information. And adding a
wi-fi dongle seemed like a good idea for a machine like this.

Admittedly, these are toys. Pure indulgence, a guilty pleasure, as I
still don't know what I will do with the Pi. It will be interesting
finding out, though.
