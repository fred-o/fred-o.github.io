One day I noticed that my MacBook wouldn't lay flat on the table.
That's weird. I did some research, and it turned out that my battery
was swollen, and I needed to replace my machine ASAP or horrible
things would happen.

Since my workplace is awesome and lets us use pretty much whatever
development environment we want as long as we get shit done, I opted
for a Lenovo Thinkpad this time. The keyboard is _very_ nice. I did
miss having a Retina screen, but only for a day or two. 

The hard part was deciding on a Linux distro. It's been ages since I
last ran Linux on the desktop, and I haven't really kept up. After
some vaccilaiton I landed on [Regolith][regolith], but I also keep an
[Mint][mint] installation on the side since it's a really neat distro.
I've mounted `/home` on a shared partition, so switching between two
installations like this is actually pretty painless.
