I built a simple [node.js] client for fetching PokÃ©mon data from
[pokeapi.co]. You can run it on the server as well as in a browser,
although in the latter case you'd need to direct the requests through
a proxy on your origin server.

{% highlight coffee %}
PokeApi = require 'pokeapi'
api = PokeApi.v1()

api.get('pokemon', 1).then (bulbasaur) ->
    api.get(bulbasaur.moves).then (moves) ->
        console.log 'here the move list for', bulbasaur.name
        console.log move.name for move in moves
.fail (err) ->
    console.log err
{% endhighlight %}

Get the [npm here][npm], or check out the [code here][gh].
