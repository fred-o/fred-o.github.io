So yeah, one reason I haven't blogged or done any OSS work recently is
I've been playing [Hearthstone][hs] obsessively. I installed it with
some trepidation and immediately got hooked so hard it is kind of
scary. Now I can't get enough. I read the blogs, watch the streams,
follow the drama.

I'm strictly a casual player, and I've promised myself I won't spend
any actual money on this game. So in order to beef out my collection
I've been grinding the Arena for the better part of two months. The
Arena is pretty fun, as you get to play around with a lot of cards you
wouldn't usually get your hands on. It's also punishing, as you really
need to rack up those seven wins in order to recoup your gold
investment. Last week I decided enough was enough, and switched to
playing ranked games.

This season I was toiling away at level 20 for quite a while playing
different decks, but then made a conscious commitment to learn the
Shaman Way. Shaman is good for casuals like me since you can put
together a solid deck out of just commons and rares, and it will both
be fun to play and have a decent chance on the ladder. Playing Shaman
correctly isn't easy though; you have to pace yourself and learn when
to strike with [Lightning Storm][storm], when to unleash your
[Feral Spirits][spirits], and what to hit with your
[Earthshock][shock]. And most importantly, when to hold back and just
play a totem.

You also need to think hard about the mana curve. Despite being an
all-round awesome card, I realized [Chillwind Yeti][yeti] had no place
in my deck; on turn three I usually play an Overload card, which ruins
turn four. After dropping the yetis, and a few other tweaks I was
shocked how good the deck was doing. I went on win streak after win
streak and hit rank 9 today. My one to two hours of game time a day
isn't enough to take me to Legend, but it was pretty sweet to at least
break single digit.
