After hacking on and off on [emacs-eclim] for the better part of three
years, it's finally time to make an actual, honest to God,
release! With a version number and everything!

Even better, I made *two* releases, both at the same time. Thing is,
the [eclim] guys switched the format of the response messages to JSON
with eclim 1.7.3. That was a rather good change, but it meant we had
to do quite a bit of work on our end to get everything working
properly. And that's why it finally made sense to start talking about
[emacs-eclim] releases. If you are stuck on an older version of [eclim],
you need [emacs-eclim] version 0.1; but for [eclim] 1.7.3 or later you
must run [emacs-eclim] 0.2, or HEAD.
