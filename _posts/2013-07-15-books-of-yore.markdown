I'm cleaning out a lot of old rubbish from my office; I need the
space. These books are all going to the recycling plant unless I find
someone interested in them (I probably won't).

The idea of IT literature as massive paper volumes feel a bit dated
now. A book like 'Pro Spring' will be antiquated in two years tops,
and I can find out anything I ever wanted to know about Perl or XML by
just going online. 

I'm keeping the classics (_SICP_, _The C Programming Language_) and
the ones I find myself going back to (_Programming Pearls_, _Beautiful
Code_), but this lot is going. Whatever books I buy in the future will
most likely be ebooks, unless I really, really want something to
display on the shelf.
