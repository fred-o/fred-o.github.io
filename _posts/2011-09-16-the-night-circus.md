I've been playing [The Night Circus][nc] a lot lately. Well, 'playing'
is a strong word; I've been mostly clicking on random cards and
enjoying the athmosphere of the game. I'm not really making any
informed choices that influence the story, and I have little control
over the game flow. This isn't really the type of game I usually
bother with, but it does quite a few things right:

 * You don't have to create an account to play; just sign in with you
   twitter or facebook account.
 * Every move is represented by a card that you play. You get to keep
   six cards in your and you're issued a new card randomly(?) every
   four minutes. This, in conjunction with that there is very little
   state to keep track of, means that it's very easy to return every
   now and then, play a few cards and then do something else. In
   short, a perfect game to play while [you're code's compiling][xkcd].
 * There's a constant stream of small rewards. Almost every card
   played gains you a memento of some sort, and most of the mementoes
   can be used to unlock new paths in the game.
 * Also, the setting is very athmospheric in a kind of fantasy
   victorian, [Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell][strange] kind of
   way. The writing is well done, and you get the feeling that there's
   a lot to be discovered. I don't know if there's a conclusion or if
   the game ever really 'ends'. New story segments are added weekly
   however, so there's hope for some kind of coherent story.

The game builds Erin Morgenstern's upcoming
[novel with the same name][novel], and as a promotion piece it works
pretty well. At the very least, it got me engaged and actually
considering getting the book at some point.
