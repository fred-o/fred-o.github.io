It starts out innocently enough. You purchase the [Arkham Horror][ah]
base set and play a few games with friends. You have loads of solid,
insanity-inducing fun, but after a while it gets kinda repetitive
playing with the same Investigators and Old Ones over and over
again. So you start looking at expansions, picking up say,
[Innsmouth Horror][ih] and Bam! you're in Happytown again! Killing
monsters! Reading ancient tomes! Learning all things Man Was Not Meant
To Know.

Soon you have collected all the expansions, and now your problem is
that you're running out of space. The base set alone contains over 700
moving parts. Each expansion adds more game boards, cards, tokens,
markers and rule books. You start asking yourself exactly what
ridiculous amount of game components you've accumulated on your quest
to boardgame nirvana.

At least, that's what I asked myself. And so I whipped together a
web-based calculator using [GWT][gwt] and some free time. Now you too
can use it to calculate the extent of _your_ mania.

*Note: The columns are sortable; try clicking on the column
headings. You can filter the selection by (un)checking the boxes for
different expansion sets and component types.*

3222 components! Whew, that's a *lot*!
