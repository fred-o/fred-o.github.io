{% img right /media/images/kabukicho_gate.jpg 400 The Kabukicho gate %}

We just got back from a two-week trip to Japan, which was simply
_amazing_. I've seen more temples and [Torii gates][torii] than I care
to remember; I've seen the spring festival of Takayama and the Peace
Museum of Hiroshima. We went on a pilgrimage to [Akihabara], shopped
at [Super Potato][potato], and had drinks at [8-bit Cafe][8bit].

As most of my Japan knowledge comes from exclusively from playing the
[Yakuza] games, one of my personal highlights was visiting the
real-life "Kamurocho" and seeing the iconic Kabukicho gate.

Side note: Tokyo is about just about the only city on earth where I'd
feel comfortable walking around the red light district at night
snapping pictures with my big touristy camera.
