I was contacted by [Dave Clayton][redskyforge] about turning my old
[Aop.js][aop.js] code into a library and
[putting it on GitHub][repo]. I'm just glad this was useful to
someone.

Looking back at my old post now my first reaction is *"Rhino! Isn't
that just adorable."* I didn't know about Node.js back then...
