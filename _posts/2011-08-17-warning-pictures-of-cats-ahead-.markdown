I used to draw a lot as a kid, but at some point I stopped doing
it. Maybe I didn't have the time. Maybe I wasn't good enough, or never
felt like my technique improved. And from time to time I felt really
bad about quitting.

Well, a couple of days ago I dusted off my [Wacom Bamboo][bamboo]
tablet, downloaded the latest version of [ArtRage][rage], and started
sketching again. For some reason, everything turned out cats:

The first two were made using photo references. This is our oldest cat
in various poses.

This one was actually drawn from memory. This is our smallest cat, and
yes, her ears really are that large.
