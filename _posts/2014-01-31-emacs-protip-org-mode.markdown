Man, where do I start? [org-mode][org] is Emacs' Killer
Application. It started out as an very capable
[outlining tool][outline], but has grown and mutated and now people
use it for [time management][time], [blogging][blog],
[presentations][present], [spreadsheets][spreadsheet], [GTD][gtd], you
name it. Org-mode is the reason I returned to Emacs after several
years as an Eclipse refugee. I needed a system for handling my ToDos,
and after hearing good things about org-mode I installed Emacs again
and gave it a go. And here I am several years later and I pretty much
live and breathe Emacs now.

In other words: if you haven't tried org-mode, you're probably missing
out. Here, have a look at [this screencast][video]. It's short and
sweet and you know you want to.
